## Description
This project focuses on implementing and understanding search algorithms, particularly linear search and binary search. The tasks involve writing functions, analyzing time and space complexities, and adhering to specific coding standards. 

## Project Requirements
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Coding style: Betty style
- Functions: No more than 5 functions per file, only allowed to use the printf function from the standard library, no global variables, etc. 

## Tasks 

### Linear Search
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm. 

```c
int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
``` 

### Binary Search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm. 

```c
int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
``` 

### Big O Notations
Answer questions related to time and space complexities. 

- [Time complexity of linear search](2-O)
- [Space complexity of iterative linear search](3-O)
- [Time complexity of binary search](4-O)
- [Space complexity of binary search](5-O)
- [Space complexity of a given function](6-O)
